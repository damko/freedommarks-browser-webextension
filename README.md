# EDIT 2023-09-05

I'm archiving this projects as it's probably too old to be updated or useful to anyone. 

Apologies for the long queue of unanswered issue.

I personally changed my approach towards bookmarks and since a few years now I'm using this workflow:

* I send myself an email with the URL and, eventually, additional notes
* the "envelop icon" present in Firefox next to the URL bar is very comfortable for sending
* when I need to bookmark a group of tabs, I use the [Save Tabs FF extension](https://github.com/mnba/save-tabs) to quickly create the email content. I send the email with my email client.
* when I need to search for a bookmark I use my email client search functionality

The main advantages of this approach:

* super simple
* hard to break, always works
* works on any device
* easily accessible, even from phone
* easy to add any kind of note regarding the bookmark
* easy to share (email forwarding)
* easy to search

# Browser extension for Nextcloud Bookmarks

This is a cross-browser extension for [Nextcloud Bookmarks](https://github.com/nextcloud/bookmarks), a very popular bookmark application for Nextcloud.

It allows you to add, search and delete your Nextcloud Bookmarks.

This extension does not synchronize your browser bookmarks with Nextcloud Bookmarks and it will never perform any kind of synchronization between the browser and Nextcloud.

It has been tested on Firefox and Chrome but it **should** work also on Opera, Safari and Microsoft Edge.

_Note: this extension doesn't work on OwnCloud but you can fork this repo and modify the code accordingly_

## Available features

* it adds new bookmarks
* it lists latest bookmarks
* it searches for text among the bookmarks' title and description
* it searches bookmarks by tag or by a tags combination (like 'tag1 AND tag2 AND tag3' and 'tag1 OR tag2 OR tag3')
* it deletes a bookmark
* you can choose if you want to display first the bookmark form or the search form

## Missing features

* it can not search for a bookmark starting from a URL (API lacks the method)
* it can not retrieve the list of already set tags (API lacks the method)
* it does not edit a bookmark
* it lacks a translation (localization) system
* it lacks translations

# Disclaimer

This extension is **ready for production** but, of course, it can have bugs.
